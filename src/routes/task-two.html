Each capsule contains a carefully measured dose of synthetic psilocybin, which has been prepared under strict pharmaceutical conditions to ensure purity and consistency. This method of administration offers several benefits compared to consuming natural mushrooms or other forms of psilocybin:</p> <ul> <li>It allows for precise dosing, ensuring that all participants receive the same amount. This standardised approach to psilocybin administration is crucial in research settings. By eliminating the variability in psilocybin content that can occur with natural mushrooms, the use of capsules also provides a more predictable and consistent experience for participants, prioritising safety as well as maximising the scientific value of the study.</li> <li>Capsules also offer a non-invasive, convenient and discreet way to administer the compound, which is important for maintaining the study&#39;s blinding procedures and ensuring participant comfort.</li> </ul> <h4 id="what-can-i-expect-during-my-psilocybin-experience">What can I expect during my psilocybin experience?</h4> <p>The psilocybin journey is a deeply personal and often unpredictable experience. While each individual&#39;s journey is unique, the following sections offer a general guide to the different phases you may encounter. As you prepare for your own experience, remember that approaching it with an open mind, curiosity, and a willingness to let go of control can help create a positive and insightful experience.</p> <h5><em>- Onset phase (20–60 minutes after ingestion)</em></h5><br>Your psilocybin experience will typically last 4–6 hours. In the onset phase (20–60 minutes after ingestion), you may notice subtle shifts in perception. Visually, this can include enhanced colours, more pronounced patterns and geometric shapes, or 'breathing' effects, where inanimate objects seem to pulsate or move rhythmically. Your sensitivity to sounds and music may increase and you might even experience synaesthesia. Time may seem to slow down or speed up, and distances may appear distorted. Physically, you might feel bodily sensations like tingling or 'energy shifts' throughout the body, increased heart rate and blood pressure, possible nausea, stomach discomfort or vomiting, and restlessness or desire to move around.</p> <p>Emotionally, feelings of nervousness, excitement or even apprehension are common as you acclimate to the effects of the psilocybin. During this onset or 'coming up' phase, it is helpful to embrace the experience fully, allowing yourself to observe the unfolding effects with curiosity and openness. Trust the process, stay present and remember that these sensations are a temporary and a normal part of the psilocybin journey. The purpose of this preparation course is to equip you with techniques to help you flow with it.</p> <p><h5><em>- Peak phase (2-4 hours after ingestion)</em></h5><br>The peak phase (2–4 hours post-ingestion) brings the most intense psilocybin effects. Vivid hallucinations, both with eyes open and closed, are common, although not everyone experiences visual effects. Perception of time and space may feel distorted. Emotions can intensify greatly and span a wide spectrum, from euphoria or bliss to deep introspection. This can lead to reflections on personal experiences, relationships, and existential questions. During this peak phase, some people experience the so-called ego-dissolution. People often find this aspect difficult to put into words, but it has been described as feeling like you have merged with the universe, a sense of boundlessness, or a profound shift in perspective about your place in the world. While this experience can be awe-inspiring, it can also feel overwhelming or challenging at times. If you feel overwhelmed, remember that, as members of the team (who you will already have met) we will be there to support you. We will remind you to trust the process and that these sensations are temporary and part of the psilocybin journey.</p> <p><h5><em>- Comedown phase (4-6 hours after ingestion)</em></h5><br>In the comedown phase, as effects gradually subside, you may reflect on the peak phase, and even start the process of 'integrating' or making sense of any insights gained. A sense of peace, clarity and deep relaxation can often accompany this stage, though some physical and mental fatigue is also normal.</p> <h4 id="how-can-i-set-intentions-for-my-session">How can I set intentions for my session?</h4> <p>Setting an intention for your psilocybin session is a valuable way to guide your experience. In the lead-up to your session, take some time to reflect on what you hope to achieve or explore. This could be, for example, the development of personal insights, emotional healing, spiritual growth, or simply an open-minded exploration.</p> <p>Having a clear intention can provide focus and meaning. However, it&#39;s equally important to remain open to whatever experience unfolds. Sometimes, the most profound insights come unexpectedly. Remember, your intention is a guide, not a strict goal. It&#39;s okay if your experience deviates from your intention. Trust in the process and allow yourself to surrender to the journey.</p> <p>Over the course of DIPP, you will complete daily journal prompts. Many of these prompts are designed to help you reflect on your intention as well. This regular journaling practice can deepen your understanding of your intention, help you track your thoughts and feelings leading up to the session, and provide valuable insights both before and after your psilocybin experience.</p> <h4 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-encounter-a-challenging-or-overwhelming-moment">What should I do if I encounter a challenging or overwhelming moment?</h4> <p>During a psilocybin experience, it&#39;s normal to encounter challenging moments. These can be intense, but they&#39;re often part of the therapeutic process and can lead to significant personal insights. If you find yourself in a difficult place during your journey, remember that surrendering to the experience is key.</p> <p>'Surrendering' isn&#39;t about actively doing something, but rather about allowing whatever arises to be present without trying to control or resist it. It&#39;s about trusting that the process is unfolding as it needs to, even if it&#39;s uncomfortable.</p> <p>To help you navigate challenging moments:</p> <ol> <li>Trust the process: Remember that everything you&#39;re experiencing is temporary and part of the journey.</li> <li>Allow the experience: Instead of fighting against difficult feelings or thoughts, try to let them be present without judgement.</li> <li>Use grounding techniques: In Week 2, you&#39;ll learn some helpful exercises like the 4-6 breathing technique and a simple mantra affirmation. These can help you stay grounded if things become challenging.</li> <li>Remember your coping strategies: In Week 3, you&#39;ll create a personalised coping strategy plan. This will be a valuable resource during your experience.</li> <li>Reach out to your facilitator: They&#39;re there to support you and can provide guidance if needed.</li> </ol> <p>Remember, surrendering doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re helpless. It&#39;s an active choice to trust the process and allow for growth and insights. By letting yourself fully experience and move through challenging moments, you create space for potentially transformative experiences.</p> <h4 id="what-is-the-importance-of-integration-after-a-psilocybin-experience">What is the importance of integration after a psilocybin experience?</h4> <p>Integration is the crucial process of making sense of the experience of, and insights from your psilocybin journey and applying these to your daily life.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/Bw44iP/2HPO1">1</a></sup> While the psilocybin experience itself can be profound and transformative, the real work of creating lasting positive change happens after the session through deliberate integration.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/Bw44iP/XHHr1">2</a></sup> Integration allows you to process and find meaning in your psilocybin journey. It helps translate profound realisations and emotional breakthroughs into concrete, positive changes in your thoughts, behaviours and relationships.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/Bw44iP/2JsV9">3</a></sup> Proper integration supports you in navigating any challenging aspects of the experience and provides clarity on how to implement insights in a practical, sustained way.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/Bw44iP/mtpEf">4</a></sup></p> <p>In Module 3 of this preparation course, you will receive guidance on creating your own personalised integration plan. This plan will be tailored to your unique needs, serving as a roadmap for your ongoing growth and self-discovery after the psilocybin session. Your active participation in creating this plan is crucial. Reflect on what practices will best support you in processing and applying the lessons of your journey. This might include journaling, meditation, creative expression, time in nature, or talking with a therapist or supportive friends. The most effective integration involves committing to regular, ongoing practices that resonate with your needs and goals.</p> <p>Remember, while your personalised plan will guide you, integration is a highly individual process. It requires your active participation and dedication. Approach it with patience, self-compassion, and a spirit of open curiosity.</p> <h4 id="what-is-the-legal-status-of-psilocybin-in-the-uk">What is the legal status of psilocybin in the UK?</h4> <p>Psilocybin is classified as a Class A drug under the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. This classification means that it&#39;s illegal to manufacture, possess, supply, or import psilocybin without a licence. The penalties for these offences can be severe, including imprisonment. However, there&#39;s growing interest and research into the therapeutic potential of psilocybin, leading to discussions about legal reform.</p> <p>In the context of this study, we have obtained ethical approval and a licence from the UK Home Office to legally administer psilocybin. This licence allows us to use psilocybin within the strict confines of our scientific research, ensuring that we comply with all legal requirements. Participants in this study can be assured, therefore, that their involvement, and the administration of psilocybin, is fully authorised and regulated under current UK laws. This legal framework is essential for conducting research that is safe, controlled and compliant with national regulations.</p> <h4 id="if-i-have-concerns-or-questions-after-reading-this-how-should-i-proceed">If I have concerns or questions after reading this, how should I proceed?</h4> <p>If your questions are specific to the study or your participation in it, reach out to the study coordinators or researchers.</p>

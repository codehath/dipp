<h3 id="psilocybin-basics">Psilocybin Basics</h3> <h4 id="what-is-psilocybin">What is psilocybin?</h4> <p>Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychoactive compound found in certain species of mushrooms, commonly known as 'magic mushrooms'.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/qyZVl">1</a></sup> When consumed, psilocybin is converted in the body into psilocin, a substance that interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/MHUa9">2</a></sup> This interaction causes changes in perception, mood, and thought patterns, resulting in the psychedelic effects often associated with psilocybin use. These effects can include altered sensory experiences, changes in the perception of time and space, increased introspection, and sometimes a sense of spiritual or emotional connection.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/6UbJG">3</a></sup> In recent years, scientific interest in psilocybin has grown due to its potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of various mental health conditions, such as depression <sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/jTN0g+ycyDA">4,5</a></sup>, anxiety disorders, and addiction.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/jTN0g+ycyDA">4,5</a></sup></p> <h4 id="where-does-psilocybin-come-from">Where does psilocybin come from?</h4> <p>Psilocybin occurs primarily in mushrooms of the genus Psilocybe, although it has been detected in over 200 other mushroom species.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/qyZVl">1</a></sup> These mushrooms can be found in various habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Europe and Asia. The concentration of psilocybin varies between species and even between mushrooms of the same species, depending on factors such as growth conditions, stage of development, and genetics.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/ooA5q">6</a></sup> Psilocybin can also be synthesised in laboratories for research or potential therapeutic purposes.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/gSODE">7</a></sup></p> <h4 id="how-does-psilocybin-affect-the-brain">How does psilocybin affect the brain?</h4> <p>Psilocybin creates its psychedelic effects through a fascinating interaction with the brain's chemical messengers and networks.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/MHUa9">2</a></sup></p> <p>As mentioned in the 'What is psilocybin' section, when you take psilocybin, your body quickly converts it into another substance called psilocin. Psilocin interacts with the brain's serotonin system, particularly the 5-HT2A receptors.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/uMwuE+QyZv5+yQkRy+lo0uF+u2lhC">8–12</a></sup> Serotonin is a chemical messenger that allows nerve cells to communicate between brain areas involved in mood, perception and cognition. By stimulating the 5-HT2A receptors, psilocin causes a cascade of changes in brain chemistry and function that give rise to the typical psychedelic effects.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/O6viu">13</a></sup></p> <p>One of the most striking effects of psilocybin is the alteration of neural networks. Under psilocybin, the brain areas that don't typically communicate become increasingly connected, leading to a more integrated state. At the same time, networks such as the default mode network (DMN), a brain system associated with self-focused thought and rumination, becomes less active. This temporary disruption of the DMN might contribute to the dissolution of the ego and the sense of unity often reported during psychedelic experiences.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/Nf7fl+OA3lC">14,15</a></sup></p> <p>Research has also shown that psilocybin can increase the brain's capacity to change and create new connections.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/BCtk1">16</a></sup> This heightened plasticity may underlie some of the lasting positive changes that people report, as it allows for new perspectives and patterns of thought to emerge.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/6UbJG">3</a></sup></p> <p>It's important to note that while psilocybin causes significant changes in brain function, these effects are temporary. As your body metabolises and eliminates the psilocybin, your brain gradually returns to its normal state. However, the insights, emotional shifts, and changes in perspective that can occur during a psilocybin experience often persist, potentially leading to benefits for mental health and well-being that outlast the brief psilocybin session.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/MjQNl+Z8ehh+pL4g1">17–19</a></sup></p> <h4 id="is-taking-psilocybin-safe">Is taking psilocybin safe?</h4> <p>Psilocybin is generally considered safe when used in controlled research settings under the supervision of trained professionals. In these contexts, psilocybin has a low toxicity profile, doesn't cause physical damage to the brain or other organs, and carries a low risk of addiction or overdose.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/ccI9U+s39mc">20,21</a></sup></p> <p>However, the safety of psilocybin use is dependent on context. In uncontrolled environments and without proper preparation and support, the powerful psychological effects of psilocybin can be unpredictable and potentially distressing, particularly for those with a history of mental health issues.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/iVLfz+elHrH">22,23</a></sup> Psilocybin can also exacerbate pre-existing psychiatric conditions and impair judgement, leading to potential behavioural risks.</p> <p>In this research study, there are integral safety measures in place to mitigate these risks. These include participant screening, controlled dosing, a supportive team and environment, and post-session integration.</p> <h4 id="what-are-the-potential-benefits-of-psilocybin">What are the potential benefits of psilocybin?</h4> <p>Although it is not a licensed treatment in the UK, research suggests that psilocybin may offer several therapeutic and personal-growth benefits, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Alleviating depression and anxiety, including in cases resistant to conventional treatments.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/jTN0g+KR2n1+lNnM1">4,24,25</a></sup></li> <li>Aiding in the cessation of smoking and potentially other forms of addiction when combined with therapy.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/SPTzz+ycyDA">5,26</a></sup></li> <li>Increasing openness, self-awareness and perspectival shifts that can lead to positive life changes.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/jLpru+ov9F8+2MoWL">27–29</a></sup></li> <li>Enhancing overall psychological well-being, including feelings of connectedness and life satisfaction.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/DYhdU+mDn3y">30,31</a></sup></li> <li>Promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive flexibility with potentially long-term underlying benefits.<sup><a href="https://paperpile.com/c/6MYk2w/DgPTq+Ty9nC">32,33</a></sup></li> </ul> <p>These promising potential benefits are most evident when psilocybin is used in controlled, supportive settings and integrated into a therapeutic or personal-growth framework. More research is needed to fully understand who benefits from psilocybin, the range of its therapeutic effects, and its mechanisms of action.</p> <h4 id="who-should-avoid-using-psilocybin">Who should avoid using psilocybin?</h4> <p>Psilocybin is not appropriate for everyone. The following individuals should avoid using psilocybin:</p> <ul> <li>Those with a personal or family history of psychotic disorders, as psilocybin may trigger or worsen psychotic symptoms.</li> <li>People with severe cardiovascular conditions, as psilocybin can temporarily increase heart rate and blood pressure.</li> <li>Pregnant and breastfeeding women, due to the lack of research on psilocybin's effects in these populations.</li> <li>Individuals with severe anxiety disorders or a history of psychological trauma should only use psilocybin under the guidance of a mental health professional. In the UK, this could only happen if you were part of a clinical trial.</li> <li>People taking certain medications, particularly psychiatric medications, should consult a medical professional before using psilocybin.</li> </ul> <p>Psychological readiness and current life circumstances should also be considered, as those in vulnerable or unstable periods may be at higher risk for adverse reactions.</p> <style>
